# CarefulFriends FrontEnd

This a wellness app, for you to get through covid in one piece. If you don’t like exercise, or have just stopped it all together then this app can help you. The app was inspired by my brother, he and his friends made each other accountable for their exercise habits. If my brother did 5 push- ups then he would send a text to their group message letting them know. They were there to encourage positive behaviors for each other. With depression and anxiety disorders skyrocketing I wanted to make something that would support people through the pandemic and beyond it. This app creates healthy habits for long term use, you don’t have to overwhelm yourself with big goals i.e. running a marathon, use this app and feel good about yourself and feel good in general through accountability and encouragements from like minded individuals.

## Approach

- Organize into manageable pieces using Google Docs and Trello
- Started with the bare bones and then separated everything into easy to read components
- Added fetch routes and forms
- Fleshed out the the app's pages with react-router-dom
- Added JWT Token and authorization at the end, having done that next time I will be starting with it. It was harder to add everything after the fact.
